The trajectory details the iterative development of a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for GGeese Studio, an XR game studio, focusing on their product ArcadiaX. The AI engineer started by gathering initial requirements, then built the frontend with mock data, incrementally adding pages like Home, Gallery, Experience, and Contact, along with core components like Header and Footer.

Significant effort was dedicated to refining the user experience and design, particularly the header transparency, hero section visuals, and content organization. The AI engineer repeatedly addressed user feedback on consistency, visual appeal, and content accuracy (e.g., differentiating GGeese Studio from ArcadiaX, adding specific games, team, community, and investor information). Debugging efforts were observed for JSX errors. The final stages involved a complete rework of the header, the hero section, and the creation of a detailed ArcadiaX product page, ensuring clear brand separation and an engaging user interface.

<product_requirements>
The user, representing GGeese Studio, an XR Game Studio, tasked the AI engineer with building a conversion-optimized, agency-quality website. The core product is ArcadiaX, a mixed reality social gaming platform featuring drift karts and other party games (Paint Battle, Ghost Hunt, Whack-a-Mole, Holy Cows) that transform empty spaces into MR game centers.

Initial requirements included:
- Showcase the mixed reality drift karting concept.
- Ability to add placeholder videos (3 demos) and 10 clickable images for a gallery.
- An interactive element, ideally a 3D viewport demonstrating MR space transformation.
- Essential pages: Home, About, Services, Portfolio/Gallery, Contact.
- Contact methods (form, email, phone, social links), potentially booking.
- Design emphasizing innovation, fun, and the company's logo colors (purple-to-pink gradient accents).

Over several iterations, the user provided feedback and refined requirements, including:
- Fixing a white header issue on scroll.
- Removing a large logo moving up and down animation and testimonials.
- Redesigning the interactive element.
- Ensuring design consistency across sections, using logo colors and vibrant gradients.
- Removing small button-like headers (badges) and reducing visual clutter.
- Enlarging the ArcadiaX logo and improving background aesthetics.
- Making game entries clickable to expand into modals with descriptions.
- Replacing a Services section with Who Is It For (with icons).
- Removing Twitter from social links.
- Fixing a bouncy thing and clutter in the hero section.
- Resolving duplicate party games sections.
- Adding a Join the Community section with LinkedIn, Discord, Reddit, Instagram.
- Creating a dedicated Locations/Investor page with detailed information and pricing (€30 per player, 4-6 players max), derived from provided documents.
- Redesigning the home page to clearly differentiate GGeese Studio (XR Studio) from its product ArcadiaX (mixed reality drift karting software kit).
- Ensuring Pioneering Mixed Reality Entertainment is the main headline on the home page.
- Reworking the Experience page into a comprehensive ArcadiaX page, explaining everything the product does.
- Adjusting spacing for key elements like the flagship product section.
